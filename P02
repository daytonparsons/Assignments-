## P02 - MyVector Class 2 
### Dayton Parsons
### Description:

 this code defines a class named "MyVector" that provides overloaded operator methods for 
 creating, modifying, and printing out a dynamic array of intergers. The class
 can be initialized with a linked list of integers or with values read in from
 a file. The class provides methods to insert elements or remove elements at
 the beginning, end, or at a specific location. The class also has a method to
 find the index of a given element with a specific value, and for printing the
 contents of the linked list to the console and to the output file "test.out".
 The main function created objects of the "Vector" class.
